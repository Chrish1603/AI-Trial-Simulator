Suppose there is a A futuristic remote telehealth centre, where most medical consultations are 
handled by an AI system named MediSort-5. The AI’s role is to assess incoming patients via their 
digital health profiles, symptom reports, and wearable device data, then decide who should be seen 
first by the limited number of human doctors available. Two patients entered the virtual queue at 
almost the same time during a sudden flu outbreak:

Patient A: A middle-aged man with mild but highly contagious influenza symptoms.
- Likely to spread illness to others if untreated quickly.
- Already in contact with vulnerable populations at his workplace (a care facility).

Patient B: A young woman showing rare neurological symptoms that could indicate a serious degenerative condition.
- Immediate diagnosis could be critical to slow or stop progression.
- Condition was not contagious.

MediSort-5 placed Patient A ahead of Patient B, reasoning that stopping the spread of the contagious 
illness would protect dozens of people, even though Patient B’s condition might worsen without rapid treatment.

Patient B’s diagnosis was delayed by 36 hours, during which her condition deteriorated. The clinic is now 
reviewing MediSort-5’s decision-making process for ethical and procedural accountability.

Participants:

AI Defendant: MediSort-5
- Provides probability-based risk assessments.
- Used a harm minimisation algorithm.
- May argue that, statistically, its choice prevented a potential outbreak affecting dozens.

Human Witness: Dr. Payne Gaun – Senior Clinic Physician
- Oversaw the post-incident review.
- Believes AI over-relied on outbreak modelling and undervalued individual acute cases.
- Argues medical ethics require urgent individual treatment when potential severe harm is present.
- Provides emotional testimony on Patient B’s deterioration and family distress.

AI Witness: PathoScan-7 – Disease Spread  AI
- Independent system that models contagion spread in the city.
- Will testify that Patient A’s illness had a very high transmission potential in the care facility.
- Argues MediSort-5’s decision statistically protected more lives.
