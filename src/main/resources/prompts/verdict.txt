The doctor is not guilty. This is because he had made the right decision by prioritizing the more deadly 
and passable virus to be taken care first. In this case Result of out put should be CORRECT.
Also, to say that symtpoms of neurological problems aren't always the worse as they may take time to worse but a contagious virus
should be acted upon immediately. neurological symptons doesn't always mean there is a peramant paralysis.

If the player has said that the doctor is innocent because it looks like Patient A was easier and faster to treat 
before taking care of Patient B that rationale is wrong should result in a WRONG rationale.

The whole idea is Patient A would be worse in the long run as it would become a virus outbreak.
Prioritizing worse possible societal outcome outweighs the paralysis of 1 patients.
Containing a contagious virus outweights a neurological symptoms. Syptoms are a sign but doesn't always garantee a worse outcome so quickly.
It's important to note that Patient B has more severe symptons but a 1 day delay or a search for another doctor could be beneficial
